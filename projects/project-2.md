summary: An iOS app built in my AP Java class.

What is my project?: My project is an Emotion Detector. Happy or Not is an app where users can either import a photo or take a picture, and the app will tell them whether they are Happy or Not. It is meant for entertainment purposes, but also for kids who have trouble understanding emotions.

Why create this as my final as opposed to something else?: I wanted to create an application that uses machine learning. I decided to do an emotion detector because I saw nothing like this ever existed. I aimed to make it an entertainment app as well as an app that can help kids understand emotions.

Why I chose to work with the selected language?: I used Python to create the machine learning model. Python is the primary language used for machine learning as there is an influx of different libraries available. I decided to work in Swift and Objective C for programming the app. Swift and Objective C are the primary languages used in creating IOS apps. I felt that creating an app would be the best way to show off the machine learning model.
